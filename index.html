  <h3>Getting Stockr online</h3>
  <h4>5/7/16</h4>
  <p>It was more of a struggle getting Stockr running online than I expected, I think because I've never launched a Nodejs app and they have some funky requirements for getting the Node server to continue running remotely even when I'm not logged into my production server and telling it to run. I found a npm package call <a href="https://github.com/foreverjs/forever">Forever</a> that has done the trick for now, though it's not supposed to be that great a method. I'm still trying to figure out if it will work fine for my small app's needs, and if Forever's limitations are more something to worry about for enterprise apps.</p>
  <p>I haven't had a chance yet to get Stockr running at a domain name yet, but you can access it at it's IP address here: <a href="http://104.236.243.250:8080/?#/">http://104.236.243.250:8080/?#/</a></p>
  <p>This app is still pretty fragile, and there are some definite kinks to work out. Please use the guidelines below to get it working for the time being :p</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use Chrome to view the app.</li>
    <li>The first time you click the form's "Compare button," data doesn't yet populate to the page. I think what's going on is that the data has been pulled from the APIs, but my app has gotten the updated information in time to print it. I'm working on getting the results to print to the page as Stockr receives them, but for the time being clicking the "Compare" button twice will allow the results to show</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Those are the main things to keep in mind, I found the others were quick fixes as I was writing this post. You can find my code's repository here: <a href="https://github.com/ktbee/stockr">https://github.com/ktbee/stockr</a></p>

  <h3>Final presentation arcs and to-dos</h3>
  <h4>4/28/16</h4>
  <p>For my final presentation, I plan to have two arcs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arc 1: Explain why I'm doing a project on the stock market</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Stock market has felt like it's played a consistent role in my young adulthood (subprime crisis in Cleveland, market crash of '08)</li>
      <li>Enjoy the idea of correlations and pretty data displays, which the stock market feels like it lends itself to</li>
      <li>A lot of market predictions feel like they've been pulled from a crystal ball, so why not make my own?</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Arc 2: Explain how this project/class has advanced my programming goals</li>
    <ul>
      <li>solidfied some existing JS knowledge, and introduced more concepts</li>
      <li>Feel like I can create tools that interact with entities on my own terms (ie, create my own tracking tool for stock market "analysis")</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>Technical pieces remaining to finish:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Line chart that plots data from stock API:</b> Connecting the data sources I'm using to my d3 visualization had been more challenging than I expected. I'm now able to draw axes specific to data returned from my api call, but I'm still getting errors for the actual data line to plot.</li>
    <li><b>Add external api:</b> I still need to pick another API to integrate and add its data pulling function in the backend</li>
    <li><b>Incorporate second API into frontend:</b> Adding my stock visualization has been a lot harder than I expected, so I expect this might be harder than I expect as well :/</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I believe those are the two main things to keep in mind. The other issues I found were quick fixes as I was writing this. </p>

  <h3>Solving scope issue with Angular</h3>
  <h4>4/18/16</h4>
  <p>These last two weeks I found that incorporating a way for my users to send information to my app was a little trickier than I had anticipated. I was able to have search parameters submitted through the frontend form -> to the app's API -> to the stock market API -> and back to the browser's web tools console. However, I couldn't get the information retreived through this process to display on the web page and I didn't receive an error message. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36654503/send-data-to-view-from-controller-function-in-angularjs">Eventually I found out</a> that I was accidentally creating two scopes, and that my page was outside the scope of where my stock information could print.</p>
  <p>Now that I can finally print stock prices to my page, I'm working on incorporating D3 into my Angular app. I found this helpful blog post on how to add simple bar graphs: <a href="http://briantford.com/blog/angular-d3">http://briantford.com/blog/angular-d3</a></a></p>
  <p>My goal for this week is to be able to create bar graphs on the frontend using D3 with some mock data. My stretch goal is to refactor how I make handle data from my API requests to TradeKing so that I can display it with D3 more easily.</p>

  <h3>Progress on my stock market app</h3>
  <h4>4/5/16</h4>
  <p>Last week during class I dug into the API I'm using for stock market data. I found that I will be able to specify a time frame for my API calls and get quote values for certain time intervals. This will be helpful for when I create bar graphs using D3.js and plotting a stock's movement over time</p>
  <p>Before next week, I am working on getting the exact API calls I need for the time periods I'm interested in then. Then I will create a UI where a user can enter in a stock symbol and a time period they want to see activity for. I'll then work on passing this information through my backend API calls and returning that information to print on the web page.</p>
  <p>My stretch goal to have done by next class is also adding a simple bar chart using this quote data. I've watched some D3 tutorials and feel pretty confident in creating simple charts. I just need to get this information from the API to be available to D3.</p>

  <h3>Creating a story map for my stock market app</h3>
  <h4>2/25/16</h4>
  <p>In developing my app for analyzing the stock market, I cam up with these answers to some of Shaunalynn and Alec's questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>What is the project's mission?</b><br>
      Allow the user to find connections between changes in stock market and their selected API
    </li>
    <li><b>Who is its audience, and what do they value?</b><br>
      Audience is myself. I value finding unusual connections between two different events or concepts that is backed up with data. A secondary audience may be other researchers looking to find a correlation they can research further.
    </li>
    <li><b>How will you know if it is successful?</b><br>
      It will be successful if I can generate charts or word maps based on user's parameters for how to compare an API to the stock market one.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here is the story map that I created for this app:
  <br>
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/hqfw1gl8empjap3/DGMD%20-%208%20of%208.jpg?dl=0" style="max-width:700">
    And these are a couple of sketches for the various screens I was thinking of:
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jhwp079vh8t11yb/DGMD%20-%201%20of%208.jpg?dl=0">
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/pbs1dey9tqy862c/DGMD%20-%203%20of%208.jpg?dl=0">
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4xubou0r3gq01hc/DGMD%20-%204%20of%208.jpg?dl=0">
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/e5epalesy3jjpsh/DGMD%20-%206%20of%208.jpg?dl=0">
  </p>
  <p>My next step now is to find a stock market API (probably Yahoo Finance) and start learning it. I think the initial version of the app will just give you the ability to query the stock market app for different time periods. From there I'll add another API and stock working on how to display the data for comparisons</p>

  <h3>Generative art and data visualization</h3>
  <h4>2/18/16</h4>
  <p>I had a great chat with Molly about developing some project ideas. Afterwards, I found that my interests fall into two main categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generative art possibilities:
      <ul>
        <li>Create tree ring growth pattern to use in current furniture project</li>
        <li>Code-ify bed bug DNA sequence into a knitable pattern for a blanket</li>
        <li>Create a random color chart generator for knitting patterns that takes in colors and sizes and generates unique color patterns each time</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Data visualizations:
      <ul>
        <li>For a final project, create an app that incorporates a stock market API with other ones for comparison (like Sunlight Foundation, weather, New York Times) to see if there are any trends to certain stock market changes</li>
        <li>Make more whimsical visualizations to answer questions like, does the length of pockets created in women's pants for a certain time period correspond to average purse sizes at that time?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>My plan now is to read about some resources on how patterns form in nature and start doing D3.js tutorials to try my hand at some straight forward data visualizations. I will practice using D3 on open data sets I find interesting, like ones from <a href="https://opendata.socrata.com/">Socrata</a></p>

  <h3>People card effect ideas</h3>
  <h4>2/3/16</h4>
  <p><a href="http://codepen.io/ktbee/pen/QyBozJ">Link to card draft</a></p>
  <p>Ideas for mouseover card effects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Image changes to Liz eating a chocolate bar. On each mouseover the image changes to less and less chocolate until finally it disappears and she has a camera instead</li>
    <li>A camera drops down around Liz's neck and a suitcase slides in from the left</li>
    <li>Background of card turns yellow</li>
  </ul>
