  <h3>Creating a story map for my stock market app</h3>
  <h4>2/25/16</h4>
  <p>In developing my app for analyzing the stock market, I cam up with these answers to some of Shaunalynn and Alec's questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>What is the project's mission?</b><br>
      Allow the user to find connections between changes in stock market and their selected API
    </li>
    <li><b>Who is its audience, and what do they value?</b><br>
      Audience is myself. I value finding unusual connections between two different events or concepts that is backed up with data. A secondary audience may be other researchers looking to find a correlation they can research further.
    </li>
    <li><b>How will you know if it is successful?</b><br>
      It will be successful if I can generate charts or word maps based on user's parameters for how to compare an API to the stock market one.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here is the story map that I created for this app:
  <br>
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/hqfw1gl8empjap3/DGMD%20-%208%20of%208.jpg?dl=0" style="max-width:700">
    And these are a couple of sketches for the various screens I was thinking of:
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jhwp079vh8t11yb/DGMD%20-%201%20of%208.jpg?dl=0">
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/pbs1dey9tqy862c/DGMD%20-%203%20of%208.jpg?dl=0">
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4xubou0r3gq01hc/DGMD%20-%204%20of%208.jpg?dl=0">
    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/e5epalesy3jjpsh/DGMD%20-%206%20of%208.jpg?dl=0">
  </p>
  <p>My next step now is to find a stock market API (probably Yahoo Finance) and start learning it. I think the initial version of the app will just give you the ability to query the stock market app for different time periods. From there I'll add another API and stock working on how to display the data for comparisons</p>

  <h3>Generative art and data visualization</h3>
  <h4>2/18/16</h4>
  <p>I had a great chat with Molly about developing some project ideas. Afterwards, I found that my interests fall into two main categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generative art possibilities:
      <ul>
        <li>Create tree ring growth pattern to use in current furniture project</li>
        <li>Code-ify bed bug DNA sequence into a knitable pattern for a blanket</li>
        <li>Create a random color chart generator for knitting patterns that takes in colors and sizes and generates unique color patterns each time</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Data visualizations:
      <ul>
        <li>For a final project, create an app that incorporates a stock market API with other ones for comparison (like Sunlight Foundation, weather, New York Times) to see if there are any trends to certain stock market changes</li>
        <li>Make more whimsical visualizations to answer questions like, does the length of pockets created in women's pants for a certain time period correspond to average purse sizes at that time?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>My plan now is to read about some resources on how patterns form in nature and start doing D3.js tutorials to try my hand at some straight forward data visualizations. I will practice using D3 on open data sets I find interesting, like ones from <a href="https://opendata.socrata.com/">Socrata</a></p>

  <h3>People card effect ideas</h3>
  <h4>2/3/16</h4>
  <p><a href="http://codepen.io/ktbee/pen/QyBozJ">Link to card draft</a></p>
  <p>Ideas for mouseover card effects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Image changes to Liz eating a chocolate bar. On each mouseover the image changes to less and less chocolate until finally it disappears and she has a camera instead</li>
    <li>A camera drops down around Liz's neck and a suitcase slides in from the left</li>
    <li>Background of card turns yellow</li>
  </ul>
